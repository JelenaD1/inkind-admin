# MVPs

- Volunteers don't have an account to access the site, only user records associated by their email address
- When volunteer requests to be contacted, the admins get notified that the volunteer is in a "flagged" state
  - Status per volunteer for now instead of per survey
- Use emojis to capture student feedback
